This is the hello-world program that is first introduced to beginning programmers

Howdy readers,

My name is Derek Phavorachit and I am an electrical engineer major at Texas A&M University. But more importantly, I am the 
loudest and proudest member of the Fighting Texas Aggies - Class of 2017!

And I just got my ring! :D

Sincerely,

DP
